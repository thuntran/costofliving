# costofliving

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Purpose

The goal of costofliving is to provide functions and data sets to calculate the average cost of living to a single person making minimum wage salaries in different states in the US in 2022. 

## Target Audience

This package targets any working individuals in the US who would like to learn more about whether they find a state livable if they earn minimum wage in that state.


## Installation

You can install the development version of costofliving from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("thuntran/costofliving")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r load-package}
library(costofliving)
```

Loading the `us_cost_of_living` data set:

```{r us_cost_of_living}
summary(us_cost_of_living)
```

This is an example of how to calculate the annual gross salary of a single person earning minimum wage in a specific state/a few different states:

```{r example-1}
grossSalaryMultiple("MA")
```

```{r example-2}
grossSalaryMultiple(c("MA","TX","IL","AL"))
```
